# ser515-ICA8
A repository for JUnit testing assignment on a urinal problem. It includes the problem itself as well as the unit tests.

The Urinal Problem:
  In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and 
  the next person peeing. For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will 
  choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the 
  same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4). 
  
The tests:
1. Test file read
2. Test countUrinals function
